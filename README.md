Introduction:
Welcome to my smart home! In this document, I will provide you with an overview of the various components and automations that make up my smart home setup. From energy monitoring to security, I've integrated a variety of technologies to create a more convenient and efficient living space.

Smart Home Components
1. Energy Monitoring:
I've integrated energy monitoring into my smart home to keep track of electricity and gas consumption. This allows me to make informed decisions about my energy usage and costs. The system includes the following sensors:

Smart Meter Electricity Import
Smart Meter Gas Import

... (and more)
2. Home Assistant Configuration:
My smart home is powered by Home Assistant, an open-source home automation platform. I've configured Home Assistant to manage and control various devices and services. This includes:

Default Home Assistant configurations for frontend and API access.
Text-to-speech using the Google Translate platform.
Group configurations for organizing devices and services.
Automation and scene configurations for streamlined control.
3. Notifications and Alerts:
To stay informed about the status of my smart home, I've set up notifications and alerts using various platforms:

Email notifications for important updates, configured with an SMTP server.
Telegram notifications via a Telegram bot for real-time alerts and updates.
Group notifications to consolidate and manage notification services.
4. Device Control:
I have integrated switches and sensors to control various devices in my home:

Wake-on-LAN switch to wake up devices remotely.
System monitor sensors to keep track of system health and resource usage.
Smart Home Automations
1. Arm Blink Alarm at Sunset:
Every day, at sunset, if the Blink alarm system is disarmed, the automation arms it in the "away" mode. It also sends notifications to my mobile app and Alexa devices to confirm the successful arming of the alarm.

2. Daily Energy Cost Notifications:
At midnight, an automation sends daily energy cost notifications. It informs me about the gas and electricity costs for the day through various notification platforms, including Telegram, email, and mobile app notifications.

3. Turn On DNS if Off for Over an Hour:
If the DNS protection is turned off and remains off for over an hour, the automation turns it back on. It also sends notifications to my mobile app and Telegram to alert me about the DNS status change.

4. Automatic Home Assistant Updates:
This automation schedules Home Assistant updates on a monthly basis. It uses a blueprint to initiate the update process and sends notifications to inform me about the update progress.

5. Disarm Blink Alarm at Sunrise:
Every day, at sunrise, if the Blink alarm system is armed in the "away" mode, the automation disarms it. It also sends notifications to confirm the successful disarming of the alarm.

6. Low Battery Notifications:
This automation uses a blueprint to monitor device battery levels. If a device's battery level is low, it sends notifications to my mobile app and Telegram to alert me about the low battery status.

7. Stale Backup Check:
If the backups are not up to date, this automation sends notifications to my mobile app and Telegram to inform me about the outdated backup status.

8. Internet Connection Status:
This automation monitors the status of the WAN port. If the connection is down, it sends notifications to my mobile app and Telegram to alert me about the internet connection issue.

9. Garden Light Timer:
If the garden light or socket is turned on for more than 20 minutes, the automation turns it off to conserve energy.

10. Hourly Blink Snapshots:
This automation triggers Blink cameras to take snapshots every hour. It saves the snapshots to the local directory for later review.

11. Conservatory Light Automation:
When motion is detected in the conservatory and the light is off, this automation turns on the conservatory light and socket. After 3 minutes, it turns them off again.

12. Back Door Open Notification:
When the back door sensor detects that the door is open, this automation sends a notification to my Alexa devices to inform me about the open door.

13. Evening Energy Cost Notifications:
At 5:00 PM, this automation sends evening energy cost notifications. It informs me about the gas and electricity costs for the day through various notification platforms.

14. Push Updates to GitHub:
Upon Home Assistant startup, this automation triggers a shell command to push updates to my GitHub repository. It also creates persistent notifications and system log entries to track the update attempt.

15. Watchman Automation:
Every day at 10:00 AM, this automation uses the Watchman service to generate a report. It sends the report via email to provide insights into the overall system health and status.

16. Motion-Activated Lights:
When motion is detected in specific rooms, this automation turns on the lights and sets a timer. If no further motion is detected, it turns off the lights after the timer expires.

With this smart home setup and the carefully configured automations, my living space is not only more efficient and convenient but also safer and more responsive to my needs. The integration of various technologies ensures that I'm always in control, even when I'm not physically present in my home. My smart home truly represents the future of living, where technology seamlessly enhances our daily lives.
